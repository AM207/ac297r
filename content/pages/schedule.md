Title: Schedule
Author: Pavlos Protopapas

#### Milestones

If you look at the [syllabus](/syllabus) you will see that there are 4 milestones: 

* PHASE 1: Investigate/research (3 weeks)
* PHASE 2: Data acquisition/experimental design and/or data preparation/exploration (3 weeks)
* PHASE 3: Formulation of solution, prototype implementation (3 weeks)
* PHASE 4: Implementation (4 weeks)

You will be graded on each phase, via an interview with Pavlos and a TA. You will have 4-5 days to improve your work in that phase based on our feedback in case we do not find your work for that phase acceptable.

#### Tutorial Schedule

There will be a tutorial every wednesday (except for spring break and reading period) at 9-11 for 2 hours at 60 Oxford St, Classroom 330.

This is the tentative list of topics, in order, subject to change:

1. Pandas, Statistics, and Visualization: A quick overview of the scientific python stack
1. Supervised Learning using scikit-learn
1. Bayesian Inference using pymc (and perhaps Stan)
1. Model Selection in Frequentist and Bayesian
1. Model Ensembles
1. Scientific Writing and presentation
1. Deep Learning using Theano (and perhaps Kaffe)
1. Running large scale models on AWS or a cluster.
1. Optimization techniques and unsupervised clustering using EM.
1. Graphical Models

If time allows:

1. Gaussian and Dirichlet Processes
2. Re-inforcement learning.



#### Meeting Schedule

With Professor and TA in B155, IACS.
