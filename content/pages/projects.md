###Predicting passenger patterns on the T

Using data from the MBTA’s fare collection system, you will develop predictive models of ridership patterns based on past travel. This will include both internal patterns and the influence of external events (i.e. events at the Garden or Fenway.). 
###Classifying everything on the sky

Using the Pan Stars data we want to 
Create a training set for all kind of objects known to astronomers. For this to happen we need to use known objects for other surveys and transfer learning. Transfer learning is when a training set is not available as such but machine learning methods have to be used to make one. We then want to create a probabilistic classification model that classifies everything and evaluate its accuracy. A possible extension would be to evaluate when follow-ups may be done.


###Social Media Epidemiology

Traditional clinical methods to track the incidence of diseases are essential to prevent outbreaks, they frequently take weeks to spot critical epidemiological events. Analysis of social media has given rise to multiple digital disease surveillance systems capable of providing timely epidemiological information to public health decision makers (two to three weeks) ahead of traditional reports.

Challenges in the design and implementation of these digital disease tracking systems include finding, downloading, storing, analyzing, and visualizing enormous amounts of information continuously in time. 
###Detecting Topics and Understanding Citations

Nearly every Physics, Astronomy, and Geophysics article refereed in the past 20 years is fully indexed and served by the ADS. 50,000 scientists and librarians use the ADS daily. The ADS’s bibliographic dataset currently consists of over ten million documents, and is growing at a rate of several thousand per month. There are multiple projects of interest, including:

* Detect topics from a paper using NLP techniques for entity recognition (could be an ontology, thesaurus, or just controlled dictionary).  
* Improve ADS’s reference resolving framework using state of the art techniques such as Conditional Random Fields (CRF).
* Extract the context in which a citation is provided in a paper and characterize its use. The references in the text would then be coupled with the nearby (according to some proximity measure) subject matter tags to form an external view of the subject matter in the reference. 
###Exposing Dodgy Erotic massage parlors

Polaris, an anti-human-trafficking organization, is interested in exploring how computational science can assist in identifying locations, businesses, and individuals participating in human trafficking operations. Anecdotal evidence from the National Human Trafficking Resource Center hotline and from human trafficking survivors indicates that the industry is highly networked and that women in the industry are often coerced.

You will focus specifically on the Erotic Massage parlor business. Since the erotic massage parlors operate as seemingly legitimate businesses, there is a significant amount of data and information about them on the web. Through computational methods, Polaris hopes to 
identify establishments with a high probability of involvement in trafficking activities, find links between them and 
identify the most influential individuals / businesses in the industry

###Conceptual Physics from Machine Learning

We will apply powerful machine learning to gain conceptual understanding in physics. For example, we have used kernel SVMs and feed-forward neural networks to define the concept of a defect in disordered systems, which could not be done before. We are also working on using neural networks, with similar topology to recurrent networks in natural language processing, to find a good representation for atomic configurations in quantum mechanical calculations. 
###Market Beta

The broad problem is how to best estimate, given information available today, a stock's "market beta", the relationship between the price of a stock and a market index in the future. It describes what percentage move in the stock we should expect given a one unit move up or down in the index. 
 
The simplest solution to the problem is to regress the prices or returns of a stock on the index return or price.  However, below are some considerations that merit further research to refine the estimate, such as optimal backward-looking timescales for a week-forward prediction, corrections for thinly traded stocks, newly traded stocks (such as those from IPOs), significant company news, and changes in the macro environment. Does the stock shrink to the index, rendering a beta of 1?
###Deep Learning and the Brain Connectome.

Deep learning methods for Connectomics: segmentation of individual neurons and their synapses is currently done using convolutional neural nets. Our goal is to explore other deep learning architectures to speed up the prediction without a significant loss in performance.

Higher level assembly of neuronal structures from error prone pre-segmentations based on biological models: Currently our automatic reconstructions need manual proofreading to correct for split and merge errors in the 3D geometry of the neurons. Goal is to build on top of the automatic reconstructions and correct split errors by looking at 3D segments and merging them into biological plausible neurons. A first idea to explore is to use deep learning to predict if segments should be merged, and then use biological constraints to identify biologically plausible groupings based on the deep learning results.

Synapse detection for Connectomics: While state of the art methods for synapse detection using computer vision approaches use random forests and boosting on hand designed features to classify each pixel in the images, we want to explore deep learning methods for this purpose. 

The data is already acquired and we have sufficient manual annotations for deep learning.
