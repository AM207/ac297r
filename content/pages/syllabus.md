### Projects

You will be dealing with real-world problems, messy data sets, and the chance to work on an end-to-end solution to a problem using computational methods. 

Professors and TFs will work with partners/collaborators from science, industry, government or the non-profit sector to select and prepare project goals and data. Projects will be selected to combine the statistical, computational, and engineering challenges and social issues involved in solving complex real-world problems.  Additional mentors for the project may be recruited to assist with particular projects. 

Students will be placed in groups and each group will work with the instructor who together will identify a particular problem they would like to solve. Students will also work with the instructors and mentors or partners to understand the overall problem, define the problem, and propose a solution. These solutions will be either in the form of a software package, recommendations or a research papers. CSE-CP problems will be open-ended that primarily deal with real-world problems. Students will go through the whole cycle of solving a real-world problem in a project team: 

* acquiring, organizing and processing data
* creating and outlining solutions
* implementing those solutions
* communicating and defending their work.

Students will be setting their own deadlines, determining roles within the group and  managing group dynamics. Professors and TFs will guide students through the process and provide feedback. 

A very important component of the capstone project will be the significant feedback provided to the students, which should be a learning tool in itself. Students will be given explicit measures for evaluation, regular feedback on all aspects of the project and its implementation, as well as opportunity for self-assessment. This will begin with the data acquisition and data exploration and extend to the design phase of the project. Students will receive significant input from the instructor and teaching fellows on all aspects beginning with the choice of project and a written proposal and plan of work. Students will be required to give bi-weekly updates and to attend weekly face-to-face review sessions with the instructor and/or mentors. This continuous open dialogue will ensure the achievement of the learning outcomes.

The course will be broken down into the following  four phases:


####PHASE 1: Investigate/research


>Topics and CSE learning outcome covered

* Overview of problem solving strategies
* Investigate known techniques
* Evaluate and select appropriate statistical and mathematical models (CSE learning outcome)
* Use visualization (CSE learning outcome)
* Evaluate and compare multiple computational approaches and choose the most appropriate and efficient one  (CSE learning outcome)
* Problem statement definition 
* Project management 
* Communicate across disciplines and collaborate in a team  (CSE learning outcome)

>Major Deliverables 

* Literature search and background 
* Presentation on findings 
* Presentation on problem statement

####PHASE 2: Data acquisition/experimental design and/or data preparation


>Topics and CSE learning outcome covered

* Understand and design data structures, data management, and data cleaning techniques  (CSE learning outcome)
* Design experiments and strategies for data collection  (CSE learning outcome)
* Use visualization (CSE learning outcome)
* Communicate across disciplines and collaborate in a team  (CSE learning outcome)

>Major Deliverables

* Data exploration and strategies for data cleaning and data structure
* Presentation on data aspects
* Interaction with partners


####PHASE 3:  Formulation of solution, prototype implementation


>Topics and CSE learning outcome covered

* Brainstorming 
* Concept selection 
* Produce a computational solution that is reproducible  (CSE learning outcome)
* Model complex systems with consideration of efficiency, cost and data availability  (CSE learning outcome)
* Apply machine learning techniques (CSE learning outcome)

>Major Deliverables

* Present multiple ideas and comparison amongst those ideas
* Obtain partner feedback 
* Presentation of final concept selection with quantifiable choice specifications 



####PHASE 4: Implementation  


>Topics and CSE learning outcome covered

* Use computation for advanced data analysis (CSE learning outcome)
* Apply techniques and tools from software engineering to build robust, reliable, and maintainable software (CSE learning outcome)
* Take advantage of parallel and distributed computing and other emerging modes of computation, both in algorithms and in code implementation (CSE learning outcome)
* Project management, continued 
* Communicate across disciplines and collaborate in a team  (CSE learning outcome)
 Evaluate and apply appropriate optimization methods (CSE learning outcome)

>Major Deliverables:

* Final solution presentation
* Software implementation delivered
* Self and peer evaluations (submitted) 
 
###Deliverables 

1. Final report (group)
2. Final presentation (group, one or more students may give the presentation)
2. Self evaluation (individual)
3. Peer evaluation (individual)
4. Project website (group): Students will develop a web page which briefly describes their project and includes a demonstration video. 
5. Project video (individual): Each student will create a three minute screencast with narration showing a demo of their work.  




### Course Grade

Course grades for this course will be based on the overall performance of each phase. The grade will be  determined based on the novelty and robustness of the  final solution, how well it addressed the problem 
statement, and how it was presented in the final presentation and report. 

In addition grades will be given on the following 2 areas:
1. Class Participation 
2. Teamwork 


<ul>
	<li>2% Teamwork </li>
	<li>8% Participation </li>
	<li>90% Final project </li>
</ul>
</p>

It is strongly recommended that you attend all the tutorials, as they will be fun. You will learn and work hands-on on advanced topics during the tutorials. Tutorial notes and  notebooks will be posted online, but do not expect all the material talked about in class, as well as questions posed and their answers to be in these notes. We will demonstrate (and you will work hands-on) a lot of the methods with these examples during class. 

There will be a piazza page for all discussions and announcements. Participation in these discussions counts 8% towards your grade. The Piazza discussion will revolve around tutorial subjects and elements of your project.

Students are encouraged to talk about their projects, difficulties and all, on the forum. Students are encouraged even more to engage with students doing other projects: we promise it will make your experience more fun, and your knowledge base larger.

### Tutorial Topics

These are the topics which will be covered in the tutorials. The list below reflects a rough ordering of topics. The actual order will likely shift around a bit. The course will be taught using Python as the language of implementation.
